Goal:You are to implement the Depth-First Search (DFS) based algorithm for (i) testing whether or not the input directed 
     graph G is acyclic (a DAG), and (ii) if G is a DAG, topologically sorting the vertices of G and outputting the 
     topologically sorted order.
     
THIS PROGRAM MUST BE RAN IN PYTHON 3.7!
--
OTHERWISE YOU WILL GET A INPUT BUG ON SEARCH!
--
Open terminal (or command line if you're running Windows) head to the
directory for the unzipped program (Where you unzipped the turn-in file)
You should see main.py and some other python source files.
To run the program simply type:
python main.py

- This assumes you have python installed correctly!

A command-line user interface will guide your through the process of
testing the different algorithms and output the results to a file in
the working directory of the program.
Obviously, python must be installed for this to work correctly.
No external requirements or imports should be required.

- All output goes to console, as per requirements.
